Array
Array is a sequence of variable that stored are to next each other and have the same type.
When you wanna create more than one variable at the same time that have the same type
and are connected to each other in some way you wanna create an array
 it would be therwise be like
 int var1 ,bar2,var3,var4
 
 but we can use array 
 int[] Array; its empty
 here you din reserve in the memory
 if you wanna reserve something you type new
 Array= new int[30]
 
 Here you tell the memory hey i wanna create reserve in memory space for 
 30 variable type is int and place them next to each other in memory ,so that you can access them 
 very easily using index
 
 Array[0]=80,you count from zero in arrays
 sysout(Array[0]);
 
 you cant acces something which is out of scope ,you gonna get an error
 Array[31]///not reserved in the memory
 
 thats why in main method args is the name of the array,you can send arguments here
 public static void main (string[] args)
 
 you can also initialize an array like that
 
 int[] array ={1,2,4,45}
 
 this soln is rarely used coz you dont know what will be inside an array coz they are sent form database 
 from file,but thecan be situations when you wanna initialize in one line
 the cool thing is you can add things here and sze wud increase
 
 length of the array
 
 sysout(array.length)
 4 
 
 when you wanna access last element of the array you use
 sysout(array(array.length-1))
 45
